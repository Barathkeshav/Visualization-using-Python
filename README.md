# Visualization-using-Python

This project aims to develop static visualization skills and apply probability and statistical
analysis to real-world data. The primary objectives
are to use the different python libraries for static visualization and to apply probability and statistics skills
for in-depth analysis of the selected dataset. 

In the first part of the project, the dataset was picked from data.gov which contains the NYC Job Postings that are available to
see on the official site for the City of New York. The data includes listings that are only available
to city employees and listings that are open to the public. Here we have done the analysis of the dataset using Python library Matplotlib

In the second part of the project, the dataset we have used is Arrest Data from 2020 to Present, This dataset is maintained by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and records information on all arrests made within the jurisdiction of Los Angeles. It provides crucial details about individuals taken into custody, including demographic attributes, location, and legal disposition. Here we have done the analysis of the dataset using Python library Seaborn
