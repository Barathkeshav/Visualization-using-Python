# Visualization-using-Python

This project aims to develop static visualization skills and apply probability and statistical
analysis to real-world data. The primary objectives
are to use the different python libraries for static visualization and to apply probability and statistics skills
for in-depth analysis of the selected dataset. 

In the first part of the project, the dataset was picked from data.gov which contains the NYC Job Postings that are available to
see on the official site for the City of New York. The data includes listings that are only available
to city employees and listings that are open to the public. Here we have done the analysis of the dataset using Python library Matplotlib
